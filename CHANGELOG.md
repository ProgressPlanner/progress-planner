= 1.1.0 =

In this release, we've added more recommendations from Ravi on how to improve your site. We've also made these recommendations more visible on your WordPress
settings pages, by showing on settings pages exactly which things we think you should change. Also, if you're just now starting to use Progress Planner,
we've made the onboarding experience a lot more fun: we show you immediately which of Ravi's recommended tasks you've already completed and we give
you points for those!

Added these recommendations from Ravi:

* Properly set your [permalink structure](https://progressplanner.com/recommendations/change-default-permalink-structure/).
* Fix it if your site is [set to not be shown in search engines](https://progressplanner.com/recommendations/blog-indexing-settings/).
* Rename and change the slug of your [Uncategorized category](https://progressplanner.com/recommendations/rename-uncategorized-category/).
* Remove [inactive plugins](https://progressplanner.com/recommendations/remove-inactive-plugins/).
* [Upgrade your PHP version](https://progressplanner.com/recommendations/update-php-version/) if needed.
* [Fully disable comments](https://progressplanner.com/recommendations/disable-comments/) if they're not needed on your site.

Bugs we fixed:

* If you had `WP_DEBUG` set to false, the plugin would still tell you to disable `WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY`. We think Ravi was a bit overzealous in his recommendation, so we've fixed that.

Under the hood:

* We've added our set of debug tools straight into the plugin. If you define `PRPL_DEBUG` as `true` in your `wp-config.php` file, you'll get a PRPL Debug admin bar menu item.
* Improved suggested tasks completion conditions so they don't trigger at the wrong moment.

= 1.0.4 =

Enhancements:

* We've moved Ravi's recommendations to the top left of your Progress Planner dashboard. They're the most important thing on there, so we wanted to give it prime placement.
* We changed "Update post" to "Review post" / "Review page" and [wrote better instructions for reviewing old posts and pages](https://progressplanner.com/recommendations/review-post/). These tasks now prioritize the most important pages, like your About page, Privacy policy, Contact page and FAQ page.
* Added an option to redirect users to the Progress Planner dashboard after login. The WordPress dashboard isn't particularly useful in our eyes, this mind entice you to action more.
* Added a plugin-deactivation feedback form (we tell you, because you'll never see it, right? :) ).
* Removed the celebration for "Perform all updates" if it was done by WordPress's automatic update. We all love confetti, but when it comes all the time without you doing anything, it loses its value, right? Hence this fix.

We've added the following Recommendations from Ravi:

* [Setting site icon](https://progressplanner.com/recommendations/set-a-site-icon-aka-favicon/).
* [Setting the tagline](https://progressplanner.com/recommendations/set-tagline/).
* [Deactivating the display of PHP debug messages](https://progressplanner.com/recommendations/set-wp-debug/).
* [Removing the default WP "Hello world" post](https://progressplanner.com/recommendations/delete-the-default-wordpress-hello-world-post/).
* [Removing the default WP "Sample page" page](https://progressplanner.com/recommendations/delete-the-default-wordpress-sample-page-post/).

Under the hood:

* Improvements to the REST-API endpoint for getting stats.
* Removed admin notices on the Progress Planner page.

= 1.0.3 =

* Properly resetting caches for monthly badges.

Enhancements:
